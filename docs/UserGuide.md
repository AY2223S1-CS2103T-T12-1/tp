## Features

:information_source: Notes about the command format:<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/CLASS_NAME]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/CS1231S` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CLASS_NAME...]` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times since it is also optional), `c/CS1101S`, `c/CS2030 c/ST2334` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
