**TA-Assist** is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TA) to keep track of students’ particulars and allocate marks 
for attendance and assignments. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while having the benefits of 
a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This user guide provides a brief documentation on how you can install the application and describes how each feature 
should be used. Start by looking at the quick start guide to get you started.

* Table of Contents
{:toc}


## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have **Java `11`** or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `taassist.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).
3. **Copy** the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TA-Assist.
4. **Double-click** the file to start the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Before diving into the features, the examples in this guide are formatted with the following conventions:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  * e.g `n/NAME [c/CLASS_NAME]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/CS1231S` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  * e.g. `[c/CLASS_NAME...]` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times since it is also optional), `c/CS1101S`, `c/CS2030 c/ST2334` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  * e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  * e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Modes
In TA-Assist, you can switch into a mode called the **focus** mode, which lets you run tasks that are specific to (module) class. Therefore,
[some commands](#features-available-in-focus-mode) can only be executed when you are in focus mode. Commands that you can run in the default (unfocused) mode can also
be run in focus mode. On the other hand, commands that are available only in focus mode cannot be executed in the default (unfocused) mode.

Let's first begin with the commands available in the default mode.

| `find`     | `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS...]`        |
| `list`     | `list`                                   |

### Create session: `session`

{% include note.html content="

" %}

{% include tip.html content="

A session can be treated as a "task" a student has to complete in the class. These tasks usually have an associated
grade. For example, **Tutorial 3 Participation** of **CS2100** is a task because they contribute to the
overall grade for the module CS2100.

" %}

Format: `session s/SESSION_NAME [d/DATE]`

- Creates a new session with name `SESSION_NAME` on `DATE`. If the `DATE` field is empty, the current date will be used.
- `DATE` field should follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The session names are **case-insensitive** (i.e. if a session **Lab 1** already exists, `session s/lab 1` will not create a new session **lab 1**). 

Example:

- `session s/Lab 1 d/2022-08-11` will create a session `Lab 1` on 11 August 2022.

" %}

Format: `grade INDEX... s/SESSION_NAME g/GRADE_VALUE`

- Grades the students in the specified indices on the session `SESSION_NAME` with a grade of `GRADE_VALUE`.
- `GRADE_VALUE` must be a number (decimal points are allowed).
- The session name is **case-insensitive**.

Example:

- `grade 1 2 s/Lab 1 g/93` will give the students at index 1 and 2 a grade of 93 for the session **Lab 1**.
- The session name is **case-insensitive**.

### Show students' grades for a session: `scores`

{% include note.html content="

Shows the grades of all students for a session.

" %}

Format: `scores s/SESSION_NAME`

- Shows the grades of all students for the session `SESSION_NAME`.

  <br/>   
  <img src="images/scoresAssignment1Result.PNG" width="600"/>
  
  In the above example,     
  - **Alex Yeoh** and **Bernice Yu** have been graded with the scores `100.0` and `85.0` respectively.
  - **Charlotte Oliveiro** and **Irfan Ibrahim** have not been graded, hence their cells have been marked red.

" %}

Format: `lists`

- Lists the sessions that have been created for the focused class.

### Export class data: `export`

{% include note.html content="

" %}

{% include tip.html content="

Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files can be opened with **Microsoft Excel**, where you can get an organised view
of all the data.

" %}

Format: `export`

- The exported class data includes:
  * Student names of the class.
  * All session names of the class.
  * The grades of the students corresponding to each session.
- An example generated csv file when opened in Microsoft Excel:
![Example Excel file](images/exampleExcelFile.png)
  - First column shows all the student names.
  - Subsequent columns show the grade for a student for a session (e.g. **David Li** scores **0** for **Tutorial 1**).
