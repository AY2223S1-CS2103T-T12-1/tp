### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TaAssistParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TaAssistParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TaAssistParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores data in TA Assist:
  * all `Student` objects are contained in a `UniqueList` object.
  * all `ModuleClass` objects are also contained in a `UniqueList` object.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'focused' `ModuleClass` object.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (i.e. `Ui`, `Logic` and `Storage`) as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components.

The `UniqueList` class is a generic class that stores a collection of unique elements. In TA Assist, a `UniqueList` stores either all the `Student` objects or all the `ModuleClass` objects.

<img src="images/TaAssistObjectDiagram.png" width="600"/>

Each `Student` object stores all module-class-related data in a `StudentModuleData` object. All `Session` objects corresponding to a `Student` are stored in a `SessionData` object.

<img src="images/StudentAndModuleClassDiagram.png" width="600"/>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TA Assist data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TaAssistStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taassist.commons` package.

## **Implementation**


### Assigning students to a class
<img src="images/AssignCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

DESCRIPTION TODO

### Tracking the state of focus mode
The state of focus mode is tracked by `ModelManager`, which stores the current focused `ModuleClass` (`focusedClass`, as seen in the [class diagram for `Model`](#model-component)).
When `focusedClass` is `null`, it indicates that focus mode is inactive. `ModuleManager` returns the state of the focus mode via the following methods:
* `ModelManager#isInFocusMode()` - Checks whether focus mode is active.
* `ModelManager#getFocusedClass()` - Returns the current `ModuleClass` in focus.

The following methods in `ModelManager` toggles the state of the focus mode:
* `ModelManager#enterFocusMode(ModuleClass classToFocus)` - Sets focus mode to be active.
  * This is achieved by setting `focusedClass` to be a non-null `ModuleClass` object.
  * This method assumes that `focusedClass` is an existing `ModuleClass` in `TaAssist`.

* `ModuleClass#exitFocusMode()` - Sets focus mode to be inactive.
  * This is achieved by setting `focusedClass` to be `null`.

The above methods are also exposed to the `Model` interface.

The `Logic` component calls these methods in `Model` to execute commands that require access to the state of the focus mode.

For example, the following sequence diagram shows how the `focus` command activates focus mode with the `CS1101S` module class:

<img src="images/FocusCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

On the other hand, the `unfocus` command deactivates focus mode by setting `focusedClass` to `null`.
