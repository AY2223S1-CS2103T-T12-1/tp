### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TaAssistParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TaAssistParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TaAssistParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores data in TA Assist:
  * all `Student` objects are contained in a `UniqueList` object.
  * all `ModuleClass` objects are also contained in a `UniqueList` object.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'focused' `ModuleClass` object.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (i.e. `Ui`, `Logic` and `Storage`) as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components.

#### UniqueList

The `UniqueList` class is a generic class that stores a collection of unique elements. In TA Assist, a `UniqueList` stores either all the `Student` objects or all the `ModuleClass` objects.

<img src="images/TaAssistObjectDiagram.png" width="600"/>

#### Student, ModuleClass and Session

Each `Student` object stores all module-class-related data, such as the `ModuleClass` and session data, in a `StudentModuleData` object. 
Session data belonging to a `Student` is stored in `SessionData` objects.

`Student`, `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects implement the `Identity` interface which has a single `isSame` method. The `isSame` method allows `Identity` objects to define
a weaker notion of equality than the `equals` method.

Similarly, objects that keep a reference of `Student`, `ModuleClass` or `Session` objects such as the `UniqueList` and `StudentModuleData` may also implement the `Identity` method.

<img src="images/StudentAndModuleClassDiagram.png" width="600"/>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TA Assist data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TaAssistStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taassist.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented along with explanations
for why certain functions are implemented in such a manner.

### Creating and deleting module classes

Module class information is stored as `ModuleClass` objects, which captures the name of the module class as well as the sessions created for the module class. When the user creates a module class, the program creates a new `ModuleClass` object with the module class name and adds it to the collection of `ModuleClass` objects previously created, which is managed by the `TaAssist` class.

When deleting module classes, all students previously assigned to those module classes will have the module classes unassigned from them, before the `ModuleClass` objects corresponding to those module classes are removed from the collection captured by `TaAssist`.

The following methods in `TaAssist` manages the adding and deleting of module classes from the collection:

- `TaAssist#addModuleClass(ModuleClass moduleClass)` - Adds the provided module class to the list of module classes created.
- `TaAssist#removeModuleClass(ModuleClass moduleClass)` - Removes the provided module class from the list of module classes created.

### Assigning students to module classes
<img src="images/AssignCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

Each student object contains a collection of `StudentModuleData` where module classes and the grades the student obtained for the sessions of the module classes are stored. When the user assigns students to a module class, a new `StudentModuleData` object is created and added to the collection for each student.

Given below are the different steps taken when the user assigns students to a module class.

Step 1: The user enters the command keyword `assign`, followed by the indices of the students he want to assign module classes to, and the names of the module classes that he wants to assign to the students. Example: `assign 1 2 3 c/CS1101S`.

Step 2: The program makes use of the `TAAssistParser` to make sense of the keyword, and determine which parser to use to parse the arguments. In this case, the `AssignCommandParser` is used.

Step 3: The `AssignCommandParser` makes sense of the arguments, and creates an `AssignCommand` object with the student indices and the module classes to assign them to.

Step 4: The `AssignCommand` object is executed. The student indices are be used to retrieve the `Student` objects from the list of students captured by the `Model` interface. For each student, the program creates a new `StudentModuleData` object for each module class that is not already assigned to the student. The `StudentModuleData` object only contains the module class name and not any session information. The `StudentModuleData` objects created for the student are added to the student object's collection of `StudentModuleData`.

Step 5: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object containing the success message to be displayed by the GUI to the user.

#### Design considerations:

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Let each student maintain a collection of module classes that the student is being assigned to.
  * Pros: Only captures necessary information, and easier to implement. This structure is also easier to capture session information for the students.
  * Cons: Will be creating multiple `StudentModuleData` objects for a module class when multiple students are assigned to the module class. This may cause performance issues from the large number of objects created.
* Alternative 2: Create a matrix of students and classes to determine which module class is assigned to which student.
  * Pros: Will allow fast query to whether a student is assigned to a module class, or when looking for all the students assigned to a certain module class.
  * Cons: Can possibly be storing a lot of unnecessary information. Considering the target audience of TAs, it is very unlikely for them to be teaching the same student for multiple module classes.

### Unassigning students from module classes

The implementation of unassigning students from module classes is similar to how module classes are assigned to students. The difference is that in the unassigning process, the `StudentModuleData` of the mentioned module classes are removed from the collection of `StudentModuleData` maintained by the students instead.

Refer to [Assigning students to module classes](#assigning-students-to-module-classes) for more information.

### Grading a student for a session
<img src="images/GradeCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

Giving grades for a session is only possible when a `ModuleClass` is focused. It requires updating the student's list of
`StudentModuleData`, where the matching `StudentModuleData` with the current focused `ModuleClass` is updated to reflect 
the given grade.

Given bellow are the steps taken when the user gives grade to a student for a session: 

Step 1: The user input is parsed similar to other commands and a `GradeCommand` object is created using the given 
student index, session name, and grade. 

Step 2: The `GradeCommand` object is executed. The given index is used to retrieve the `Student` object from the current
curated list of students in `Model` using the `ParserStudentIndexUtil#parseStudentFromIndex` method. 

Step 3: Then a new `Student` object is created from the old `Student` object by updating the session
grade with help of the `Student#getUpdatedStudent` method.  

Step 4: The `Student#getUpdatedStudent` method creates a new `Student` object by copying all fields from the
old `Student` object except the list of `StudentModuleData`. An updated list of `StudentModuleData` is created by calling the
`StudentModuleData#getUpdatedModuleDataList` method. 

Step 5: The `StudentModuleData#getUpdatedModuleDataList` method goes through all the `StudentModuleData` in the old list
and looks for a match with the current focused `ModuleClass`. It is guaranteed to exist since the program is in
focus mode. Then it creates a new list by updating the list of `SessionData` stored inside the `StudentModuleData`.
It is achieved using the method `SessionData#getUpdatedSessionDataList`. 

Step 6: The `SessionData#getUpdatedSessionDataList` goes through the list of `SessionData` and creates a new list 
removing any occurrence of the matching session the user is trying to grade. After that it adds a new `SessionData` to 
the list with the given `Session` and the grade. 

Step 7: After finishing steps 4-7, the `GradeCommand` will have an updated student. Then the `Model#setStudent` method
is used to replace the old `Student` object with the updated one in our model. 

Step 8: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object containing the success message to be displayed by the GUI
to the user. 

### Viewing session-wise grades of a student in a class
<img src="images/GradeCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

Viewing session-wise grades of a student is only possible when a `ModuleClass` is in focus. It requires going through
the list of `StudentModuleData` of the `Student` object and finding the data for the matching focused class. After retrieving it, 
the session-wise grade can be read from the list of `SessionData` stored inside the `StudentModuleData`.  

Given bellow are the steps taken when the user wants to view a student's session-wise grades:

Step 1: The user input is parsed similar to other commands and a `ViewCommand` object is created using the given student index. 

Step 2: The `ViewCommand` object is executed. The given index is used to retrieve the correct `Student` object from the 
curated list of students in `Model` using the `ParserStudentIndexUtil#parseStudentFromIndex` method.  

Step 3: The `StudentModuleData` of the student that matches with the current focus class is retrieved using the 
`Student#findStudentModuleData` method. This method achieves that by searching the `UniqueList` with a new `StudentModuleData`
that has the identity of the current focus class. This `StudentModuleData` is guaranteed to exist, since the program is in
focus mode. 

Step 4: The list of `SessionData` is retrieved from the `StudentModuleData` using the `StudentModuleData#getSessionDataList` method.

Step 5: A response message is constructed from the list of `SessionData`, containing all the session-wise grades of the student. 

Step 6: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object containing the constructed response to be displayed by GUI to the user. 

### Tracking the state of focus mode

The state of focus mode is tracked by `ModelManager`, which stores the current focused `ModuleClass` (`focusedClass`, as seen in the [class diagram for `Model`](#model-component)).
When `focusedClass` is `null`, it indicates that focus mode is inactive. `ModelManager` returns the state of the focus mode via the following methods:
* `ModelManager#isInFocusMode()` - Checks whether focus mode is active.
* `ModelManager#getFocusedClass()` - Returns the current `ModuleClass` in focus.

The following methods in `ModelManager` toggles the state of the focus mode:
* `ModelManager#enterFocusMode(ModuleClass classToFocus)` - Sets focus mode to be active.
  * This is achieved by setting `focusedClass` to be a non-null `ModuleClass` object.
  * This method assumes that `focusedClass` is an existing `ModuleClass` in `TaAssist`.

* `ModuleClass#exitFocusMode()` - Sets focus mode to be inactive.
  * This is achieved by setting `focusedClass` to be `null`.

The above methods are also exposed to the `Model` interface.

The `Logic` component calls these methods in `Model` to execute commands that require access to the state of the focus mode.

For example, the following sequence diagram shows how the `focus` command activates focus mode with the `CS1101S` module class:

<img src="images/FocusCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="700" />

On the other hand, the `unfocus` command deactivates focus mode by setting `focusedClass` to `null`.

### Immutability of Session, ModuleClass, and Student

In the implementation of the `Session`, `ModuleClass` and `Student` classes, it was decided to implement them in an immutable manner. 
This is done mainly for three reasons:
- Java passes its values by-reference, this can cause quite the confusion if objects returned by `Model` are mutated.
- Simplifies loading data from `Storage` as we do not need to ensure contents of data in one object has is referencing the same object as another.
- Reduces the possibility of an unobserved mutation as data in `Model` is commonly observed by `UI` through an `ObservableList`.

As such, if the codebase is to be extended to store additional classes within `Model`, it is recommended to implement them
in an immutable manner unless there's good reason not to do so.

### Identity: A weaker notion of equality

Since any modifications to an immutable object in `Model` would require constructing new objects, we'll need a method to identify
objects with the same identities, i.e. two `ModuleClass`-s have the same identity if their module codes are equal.

For instance, consider the following hypothetical scenario:

Assume the current state of `TaAssist` is as follows:

<img src="images/ImpleIdentityObjectDiagram.png" width="600" />

Now, let's say the user wants to add a `Quiz2` session to IS1103. However, since `ModuleClass` is immutable, we'll have
to construct a new `IS1103` ModuleClass instance instead. Call this new instance `NewIS1103`. Hence, the state of 
`TaAssist` will now look like the one below:

<img src="images/ImpleIdentityObjectDiagram2.png" width="700" />

Now, notice that `AlexIS1103Data` is no longer referencing the same object. In addition, since their contents
are different, we can't check with the `equals` method, as the `equals` method in our codebase should perform a strict
equality check, i.e. all contents of the two objects must be equal for `equals` to return `True`. Hence, there's no way
to identify whether `IS1103` and `NewIS1103` are *inherently* the same module or not.

To handle this issue, `Session`, `ModuleClass`, and `Student` classes implement the interface `Identity<T>` which contains a method
`isSame(T obj)` used to compare whether two objects have equivalent identities, i.e. `ModuleClass`-es have equal identity if their
module code are then same.

This `Identity` construct is similar to a `<Key, Value>` pair  in a HashMap implementation, where we use the `Key` to 
determine the object's identity and `Value` for its satellite values.

### Managing Sessions within a Class

As `ModuleClass` is immutable, there exists no methods to add/delete/modify the `Session`-s associated with a `ModuleClass`. 
The only way to do so is by constructing new `ModuleClass` instances, then replacing the new instance over the old one by
calling `Model#setModuleClass(ModuleClass target, ModuleClass newModuleClass)`.

For example, the following sequence diagram shows how the command `session s/Lab1`
creates a `Session` named "Lab1" and adds it inside the focused class.

<img src="images/SessionCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000"/>

:information_source: **Note:** The above diagram assumes that `Model` is currently in focus mode and 
the focused class doesn't contain a session named `Lab1` as of current.
